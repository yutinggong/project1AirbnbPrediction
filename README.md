Airbnb Housing Price Prediction
Programming Language: R

This is my work on solving “How much for your Airbnb?”, an in-class Kaggle competition hosted by course Applied Analytics Framework and Methods Fall 2018. The Kaggle competitions gives data sets of Airbnb housing listing and asks students to predict the price of the listings. Accruancy of the prediction is measured by RMSE.

## Random Forest
In this project, I built a Random Forest model to predict the house prices.
