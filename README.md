Airbnb Housing Prediction Using Random Forest

This is my work on solving “How much for your Airbnb?”, an in-class Kaggle competition hosted by course Applied Analytics Framework and Methods Fall 2018. The Kaggle competitions gives data sets of Airbnb housing listing and asks students to predict the price of the listings. Accruancy of the prediction is measured by RMSE.
